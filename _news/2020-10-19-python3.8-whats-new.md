## The walrus operator
Assignment expressions have come to Python with the “walrus” operator :=. This will enable you to assign values to a variable as part of an expression. The major benefit of this is it saves you some lines of code when you want to use, say, the value of an expression in a subsequent condition.

So, something like this:

```
line = f.readline()
while line:
    ...  # process line
    line = f.readline()
```
Can now be written in short like this:
```
while line := f.readline():
    ... # process line
```
