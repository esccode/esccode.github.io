## 1.0 Data Concepts and Environments 15%

### The Middle

- Find the median for this data set? `10, 30, 60, 75, 75` ?  
**`60`** 
The **middle** value in this data set is 60. So the median value is 60.

- Find the mean for this data set? `1, 4, 5, 10, 20` ?  
**`8`**
The **average** of the five numbers in the data set is 8. (1+4+5+10+20) / 5 = 8 .

- Find the mode for the data set below? `10,30,30,30,40,40,55,75` ?  
**`30`**  
The mode is 30, because it the most common number in this data set. There are three 30's in the data set.

- What is the mode for this data set? `1,2,5,5,7,10,10,30` ?  
**`This data set has two modes. Both 5 and 10 are modes.`**  
This data set is bimodal. It has two modes.

- There are a number of tools used to find the center of a data set. Which of the following statements is TRUE?  
**`The mean is the average of all the values in the data set.`**  
The mean of this data set (1,2,6) is average of all three number. The mean would be 3.

- What is the **median** for this data set with six values? `30,40,40,60,80,120` ?  
**`50`**  
The median is 50. In this data set, the middle value is the average of the third and fourth data points, 40 and 60.

- You have a simple sorted data set of `{1, 2, 6}` and decide the middle of your data is the value 3. Why is this a reasonable assertion?  
**`The value 3 is the average value of the data set.`**  
If the value of 2 were chosen instead, this would be the median for the sorted set.

- You grade exams for your class, and the grades are `{70, 73, 75, 78, 81, 85, 88, 92, 95, 100}`. How do you determine the **mode** of this set, and what is its value?  
**`The mode is the most frequently occurring value, and this data set has no mode.`**  
Since each value only occurs once, this data set has no mode.

- You have a basic sorted data set of `{54, 70, 70, 80, 85, 98, 99, 100, 102}`. What is the value 70 in this data set?  
**`the mode`** 
Recall that this is the most frequently occurring value.

### Variability

- How do you calculate the **standard deviation** of a sample data set?  
**`Sum the distance of each element of the set from the mean, divide this value by the number of elements minus 1, and take the square root.`**  

- How should you determine whether a data point is an outlier or not?  
**`There is no standard definition to identify an outlier`**.  
Once you identify a data point as an **outlier**, the next step is determining what you will do with it. 

- What are **statisticians describing** when they use **range** and **standard deviation**?
**`the variability of a data set`**

- In a national standardized test the mean score was 575 out of 800. The **standard deviation** was 75 points. So a student that scored a perfect score of 800 was ___ ?  
**`3.0 standard deviations above the mean`**.  
800 is 225 points higher than the mean, 575. 225 divided by the the standard deviation (75). So 3 standard deviations above the mean.

- Two sets of temperature data are identical, except one is in °C and the other is in °F. The **standard deviations** are 20°C for set 1 and 68°F for set 2. Which set has the greater variability?  
**`Both sets have the same variability`**.  
Since both sets contain the same data (just using different scales), the variability is identical.

- According to the **empirical rule**, how many **standard deviations** contain 99.7% of the data for a **normal distribution**?  
**`three`**

- A certain data set has a **standard deviation** of 20 and a mean of 150. One of the values in the data set is 120, what is the Z-score for this data point?  
**`-1.5`**  
The Z-score is -1.5. (120-150) / 20.

- How should you calculate the **z-score** of a data set value?  
**`Subtract the mean from the value and divide this quantity by the standard deviation`**.  
This measures the distance of the value from the mean in **standard deviations**.

- Which statement is TRUE?  
**`An outlier is a data point an abnormal distance from the other values. But there is not an exact definition of abnormal`**.  
**Outliers** are abnormal data points, but there is no exact definition of abnormal in the world of statistics.

- Find the **range** for this data set with five values? `25, 60, 95, 175, 195` ?  
**`170`**  
The range is the largest value minus the smallest value. `195-25 = 170`.

- How should you calculate the range of a data set?  
**`Subtract the smallest value in the set from the largest value`**.  
The range is a simple measure of variability.

- In a national standardized test the **mean** score was 300 out of 500. The **standard deviation** was 50 points. According to the **empirical rule**, we would expect 95% of all scores to be between _____ .  
**`200 and 400`**  
95% of scores are within 2 standard deviations of the mean. 300 plus or minus (2 times 50).

### Data and Charts

- You have a large data set of customer buying habits for an online store. How should you present this data to stakeholders interested in general purchasing trends?  
**`Create a set of graphs or tables to present the data`**.  
It is much easier to tell the data's story with tables and graphs.

- Why are **histograms** useful for representing trends in a data set?  
**`They display the frequency of events in a data set`**. 
Note that **histograms** are more useful for large data sets.
