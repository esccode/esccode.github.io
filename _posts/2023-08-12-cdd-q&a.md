### The Middle

- Find the median for this data set? 10, 30, 60, 75, 75 ?  
`60`  
The middle value in this data set is 60. So the median value is 60.

- Question 2 of 9, Find the mean for this data set? 1, 4, 5, 10, 20 ?  
`8`  
The average of the five numbers in the data set is 8. (1+4+5+10+20) / 5 = 8 .

- Question 3 of 9, Find the mode for the data set below? 10,30,30,30,40,40,55,75 ?  
`30`  
The mode is 30, because it the most common number in this data set. There are three 30's in the data set.

- Question 4 of 9, What is the mode for this data set? 1,2,5,5,7,10,10,30 ?
`This data set has two modes. Both 5 and 10 are modes.`  
This data set is bimodal. It has two modes.

- Question 5 of 9, There are a number of tools used to find the center of a data set. Which of the following statements is TRUE?
`The mean is the average of all the values in the data set.`
The mean of this data set (1,2,6) is average of all three number. The mean would be 3.

- Question 6 of 9, What is the median for this data set with six values? 30,40,40,60,80,120 ?
`50`
The median is 50. In this data set, the middle value is the average of the third and fourth data points, 40 and 60.
