## NAME
> markdown - convert text to HTML

### SYNOPSIS
> *markdown `[ --html4tag ] [ --version ] [ -shortversion ] [ file ... ]`*

### DESCRIPTION

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML filter; it translates an easy-to-read / easy-to-write structured text format into HTML.  
Markdown's text format is most similar to that of plain text email, and supports features such as headers, \*emphasis\*, code blocks, blockquotes, and links.  

> Markdown's syntax is designed not as a generic markup language, but specifically to serve as a front-end (X)HTML.  
 You can use span-level HTML tags anywhere in a Markdown document, and you can use block level HTML tags (like \<div\> and \<rable\> as well).  

> for more information about Markdown's syntax, see:

### OPTIONS

```markdown -- -z```

> `--html4tags`  
Use HTML 4 style for empty element tags, e.g.:  
`<br />`

> `-v, --version`  
Display Markdown's version number and copyright information.

> `-s, --shortversion`  
Display the short-form version number.
