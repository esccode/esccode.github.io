## Cybersecurity Threat Landscape

### Protect against UNMANAGED IoT DEVICES

Network asset inventory(skan like Nmap), NETWORK SEGMENTATION, BLOCK PORTS(e.g. telnet: 23), change default passwords, configure strong security, install software updates and patches,

### Protect against shadow IT

IT asset inventory(run nmap scan), make sure users known correct IT processes, implement and enforce strong security policies, security monitoring(SIEM), network access control(NAC), cloud access security broker(CASB)

### Protect against Supply Chain Attacks and Third-Party Risks

- Build TPRM(Third-party suppliers and vendors):  
  - inventory third-party suppliers and vendors,  
  - Determine which suppliers and vendors are business a.itical,  
  - Identify all third parties who have access to your data systems,  
  - Assign risk ratings to each of these third parties,  
  - Identify alternatives to critical suppliers and implements security controls.

- Security Controls for Third-Party Access:  
  - Follow the least privilege principle,
  - Require third parties to use MFA,
  - Monitor third parties' activities when they access your systems,
  - Revoke third-party access immediately when no longer needed,
  - Verify that third parties have strong security controls in place

- Steps to Reduce Software Supply Chain Risks
  - Conduct Software Code Inventories or Audits:  
    - Work with developers to create a software bill of materials (SBOM),
    - More information about SBOMs: [SBOM link](https://ntia.gov/sbom),
    - Some companies can analyze developers' code to generate SBOMs,
    - Review the results of the SBOMs with your developers,
    - Confirm open-source software is still needed and updated,
    - Consider implementing a secure development standard
