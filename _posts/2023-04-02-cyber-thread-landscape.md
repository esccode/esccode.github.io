### Protect against Malware and Ransomware  

1. Make Frequent Backups  
2. Apply Security Updates and Patches
3. Upgrade to Latest OS Versions  
4. Install Firewalls
5. Install Antimalware Software  

### Protect against Phishing and Smishing  

Social engineering attacks designes to trick users.

1. Email Filtering  
2. Block Bad Websites  
3. Use a Password Manager
4. Multifactor Authentication
5. Security Training  

### Protect against Business Email Compromise (BEC)  

1. Email Filtering
2. Enable MFA
3. User Security Awareness Training
4. Mark External Emails  

### Protect against Botnet and DDoS attacks

1. Use Firewalls or Web Application Firewalls
2. Use Load Balancers or Content Delivery Network(CDNs)
3. Use DDoS Defense Systems or Service Providers
4. Use a Network Monitoring System
5. Develop a Denial-of-Service Response Plan

#### Conduct a DDoS Test

#### System Protection

- Install antimalware
- Monitor system processes
- Follow good security practices

### Protect against Deepfakes

1. Train Users about Deepfakes
2. Train Users to Spot Deepfakes
3. Social Engineering: Sense of Urgency
4. Social Engineering: Unusual Behavior
5. Verify Financial Transactions
6. Verify by Asking a Personal Question
7. Ensure Finance Has Authorization Processes

### Protect against Insider Threats

1. Identify Critical Assets
   - IT systems essential for business or containing sensitive information, or both
   - Ensure they are being properly protected and monitored
   - Review and validate who has access to these assets

2. Write and Enforce Policies and Processes
   - Acceptable use policy
   - Policy on the proper use of admin accounts
   - Employee performance review process
   - Process for addressing employee grievances
   - Offboarding process

3. Implement Technical Security Controls
   - Monitor user activities
   - Follow the least privilege principles
   - Use network segmentation

4. User Security Awareness Training
   - Teach users about acceptable use of organization's assets
   - Let users know that their activity is being monitored
   - Remind users to report any suspicious activity

#### Types of Malicious insider Attacks

- Sabotage  
- Fraud  
- Theft  
- Espionage  

#### Types of Unintentional insider Threats  

- Human error
- Bad judgment  
- Falling victim to a phishing attack or malware
- Unintentionally aiding an attacker

### Protect against Unmanaged IoT Devices

1. Network-Level Protections  
   - Network asset inventory(skan like Nmap)
   - NETWORK SEGMENTATION
   - BLOCK PORTS(e.g. telnet: 23)

2. LoT Devices Protections
   - Change default passwords
   - Configure strong security
   - Install software updates and patches


#### Drivers of LoT Growth

- Rise of cloud computing
- Low cost of LoT devices
- Common use of smartphones and tablets

#### LoT Vulnerabilities

- lack of antimalware or firewall
- Default passwords
- Easily exploid with simple scripts

#### Mirai LoT Botnet

- Simple script used default passwords
- Vulnerable devices infected with malware
- Used to conduct DDoS attacks

### Protect against Shadow IT

#### Drivers of Shadow IT

- Understaffed IT departments
- Perception that IT is too slow or restrictive
- Easy SaaS solutions  

#### Shadow IT Risks

- Data loss
- Unpatched vulnerabilities
- Lack of security compliance

#### Fundamental Control

- IT asset inventory(run nmap scan),
- Make sure users known correct IT processes,
- Implement and enforce strong security policies

#### Technology Controls

- Security monitoring(SIEM)
- Network access control(NAC)
- Cloud access security broker(CASB)

### Protect against Supply Chain Attacks and Third-Party Risks

#### Build TPRM(Third-party suppliers and vendors)

- Inventory third-party suppliers and vendors,  
- Determine which suppliers and vendors are business critical,  
- Identify all third parties who have access to your data systems,  
- Assign risk ratings to each of these third parties,  
- Identify alternatives to critical suppliers and implements security controls.

#### Security Controls for Third-Party Access

- Follow the least privilege principle
- Require third parties to use MFA
- Monitor third parties' activities when they access your systems
- Revoke third-party access immediately when no longer needed
- Verify that third parties have strong security controls in place

#### Steps to Reduce Software Supply Chain Risks

1. Conduct Software Code Inventories or Audits
   - Work with developers to create a software bill of materials (SBOM)
   - More information about SBOMs: [SBOM link](https://ntia.gov/sbom)
   - Some companies can analyze developers' code to generate SBOMs
2. SBOMs and Secure Development Standard

   - Review the results of the SBOMs with your developers
   - Confirm open-source software is still needed and updated,
   - Consider implementing a secure development standard
