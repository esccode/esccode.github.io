 “Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.” ― H. Jackson Brown Jr.

**Understanding Escape Codes in Terminals**

Escape codes are sequences of characters used in text-based interfaces to control various aspects of text display, such as color, formatting, and cursor movement. These codes start with an escape character (often represented as `\033` or `ESC`) followed by a series of characters that define the action to be taken.

For example, to display text in red in a Unix-like terminal, you can use the escape code `\033[31m`, where:
- `\033` is the escape character,
- `[31m` changes the text color to red.

Here's a simple example in Python:
```python
print("\033[31mThis text is red\033[0m")
```
In this snippet:
- The text "This text is red" will appear in red,
- `\033[0m` resets the text formatting to default.
