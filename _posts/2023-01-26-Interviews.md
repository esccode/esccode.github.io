## Describe your most challenging project?

Tips:

- Have a clear story with a specific challenge.

- Discuss action steps you took and talk about the positive impact.

I was tasked with implementing a uniform data platform for a large, multinational company with tens of thousands of employees. It had to be done in such a way that it could be used by teams spread out all over the world. There were several challenges associated with implementing a platform of this size and importance. We had to make sure the platform would be well-adopted, add value, and be approved by the executive team. Besides the technical complexities of building such a platform, this project was also challenging because we had to influence global teams. To accomplish this, I created a high-level strategy. Then, I asked Senior VPs to nominate reports to form one global team that could represent the entire organisation. Ultimately, we succeeded in building a platform that was adopted globally, thanks to a strategic plan executed by a collaborative task force that incorporated both global needs and local aspirations. Why this answer worked well: Leading a project scale demonstrates the ability to provide high-level strategy while being capable of localizing the executions. The candidate detailed the complications of the project and athe action steps taken.

*Sample answer:*
Based on my current compensation and market research from resources like Glassdor and levels.fyi, I am seeking a base salary within the range of 7000 pln to 9000 pln. I have seen similar roles that are offering $[dollar amount].My specific experience and years in the field are closely aligned with this position, making me a strong candidate to be able to jump in and quickly add value. That said, i understand that this base salary range might be on the higher and of the spectrum for a growing company, and I;m willing to consider a lesser base paired with a signing bonus or increase in restricted stock units.

- Show how a compromise or a fuller understanding led to a good outcome.

**Sample answer**
My team was given a new goal: to sell our product to a new customer segment that we hadn't  served in the past. The group had strong opinions about the approach we should take. In spite of their voices, I had concerns about their strategy; I thought it may fail as it didn't align with the client's core needs. But I was in the minority and when I spoke up I wasn't heard. i needed to find another way to make the case to my teammates. I set up a focus group with a potential client so my team could understand the challenges and priorities of the people we aimed to serve. The great news was they saw that our planned product wouldn't meet these needs, but if we made some slight adjustment to the service, we could deliver something of real value. The team rallied behind this and got on board. We were ultimately successful in bringing this client onboard--and ten more! Why this answer worked well:She shared a succinct example of a time when her opinion was in the minority. She came up with a creative way to change her team's perspective. She used this new strategy and described how well it worked.

I do have a few questions. Thanks for asking. We talked a bit about your plans to invest in training opportunities for your current employees, especially those who will be managing the company's transition to a centralized billing system. I think that this is a great plan, and I'd love to support the curriculum development. Now, will most of the training modules be designed by this team? And will they be delivered in person, via webinar, or a video format? Or will you be using a hybrid approach? Why this answer worked well: She showed that she had been paying attention to the conversation. She wanted to delve a bit further into a topic that they've just discussed. She conveyed a lot of enthusiasm about supporting what sounds like a priority project for that organization.
