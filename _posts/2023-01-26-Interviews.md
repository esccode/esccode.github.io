Example:  
I've been shipping consumer devices for the past two decades. Over the years, I've built an expertise in firmware and bootloader designs. I've been lucky to have a few great mentors over the course of my career, and find a great deal of personal and professional satisfaction being able to do the same. I currently oversee a team of engineers and have helped grow several team member into managerial roles as well. Additionally, I like to stay active within the industry community, and recently spoke at DeveloperWeek conference. I've been happy at my current role, have managed many successful product launches, and really enjoy management. I'd like to use my expertise to deliver more impact on a growing company -- to help grow and shape team and culture -- and make a significant impact in the market. Why this answer worked well: The answer was a well-rounded snapshot of professional interests and strengths. It was clear that they're active in the industry, and likely have a strong network. An interests in mentorship shows a wilingness to invest time in the company, and energy into team members.
