### 5 critical cybersecurity interview questions and answers related to terms and definisions

This section has five critical cybersecurity interview questions related to terms and definisions, along with answer to help you assess your applicants' knowledge.

1. **Explain what cybersecurity is?**
Knowledgeable candidates should be able to explain that cybersecurity is the process of protecting software and hardware from hackers and cyberattacks. For example, the process ensures that attackers cannot access sensitive information or exploit system vulnerabilities.  

2. **Explain what cryptography is?**
Can your applicants explain that cryptography involves securing digital information and data transmitted during communications?  
Your applicants should know that cryptography ensures that only the recipent of the information and the sender can view the details of the message.

3. **What is a firewall?**
Applicants should know that a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls the network's traffic. Do your applicants know that firewalls mitigate remote system access and help prevent virus or malware attacks?

4. **Explain what a VPN is.**
VPN is an acronym that means virtual private network. Your applicants should know that VPNs create secure, encrypted connections when the client's data is sent to a different point.  
They should be able to explain that the data first goes to the VPN, gets encrypted, and gets decrypted at a second point in the VPN. The  data then reaches the other device.

5. **What is SSL encryption?**
SSL, short for *secure sockets layer*, is a security technology that creates an encrypted link between browsers and web servers. Candidates may explain that SSL encryption works by protecting sensitive information used in online transactions.

### 8 cybersecurity interviews questions related to cybersecurity process

This final section contains eight questions related to cybersecurity processes that your candidates should know and understand.  

1. How do you set up a firewall?
2. How do you secure servers?
3. Which methods would you use to prevent a brute force attack?
4. How do you prevent identity theft?
5. When should you complete patch management processes?
6. How would you prevent a DDOS attack?
7. How would you prevent an XSS attack?
8. How can you implement two-factor authentication?

### 5 vital cybersecurity interview questions and answers related to cybersecurity processes  

Here are five of the essential interview questions related to cybersecurity processes, along with answers you should listen for.  

**How do you set up a firewall?**

Applicants may explain that the following process is involved in setting up a firewall:

- Secure the firewall by updating the firmware or completing the required configuration measures
- Set up firewall zones and plan a structure
- Create access lists to invite and grant access to verified users
- Test the firewall to ensure it is configured to block the intended traffic
- Maintain and continuously update the firewall
  
**How would you prevent a DDOS attack?**

Candidates may outline the following four methods to prevent DDOS attacks:

- Using services that work against DDOS attacks
- Using firewalls and configuring routers
- implementing load balancing methods
- Monitoring traffic spikes

**How would you prevent an XSS attack?**

Can your candidates explain that preventing cross-site scripting attacks requires a few steps?  
Applicants should be able to give some of the following examples:  

- Using services or tools that work against XSS
- Implementing XSS filters
- Validating and sanitizing user inputs
- Using special character encoding techniques  

**How can you implement two-factor authentication?**

Applicants should know that implementing two-factor authentication involves selecting an additional method of veryfying a user's identity. One example of such a method is smartphone verification.  

Your applicant may also mention that authenticator apps are on the rise and help organizations minimize the use of verification codes.
