## Database

 > In computing, a database is an organized collection of data stored and accessed electronically. Small databases can be stored on a file system, while large databases are hosted on computer clusters or cloud storage. The design of databases spans formal techniques and practical considerations, including data modeling, efficient data representation and storage, query languages, security and privace of sensitive data, and distributed computing issues, including supporting concurrent access and fault tolerance.

## Database management system

> Connoly and Begg define database management system (DBMS) as a "software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database". Examples of DBMS's include **MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and Mocrosoft Access**.  
The DBMS acronym is sometimes extended to indicate the underlying database model, with RDBMS for the relational, OODBMS for the object (oriented) and ORDBMS for object-relational model. Other extensions can indicate some other characteristics, such as DDBMS for a distributed database management systems.

## Classification

> This section lists a few of the adjectives used to characterize different kinds od databases;

### Datawarehouses

> archive data from operational databases and often from external sources such as market research firms. The central source of data for use by managers and other end-user who may not have access to operational data. For example, sales data might be aggregated to weekly totals and converted from internal product codes to use UPCs so that they can be compared with ACNielsen data. Some basic and essential components of data warehousing include extracting, analyzing, and mining data, transforming, loading, and managing data so as to make them available for further use.

### Operational databases

> Store detailed data about the oprerations and organization. They typically process relatively high volumes of updates using transactions. Examples include customer databases that record contact, credit, and demographic information about a business's customer, personnel databases that hold information such as salary, benefits, skills data about employees, enterprise resources planning systems that record details about product components, parts inventory, and financial databases that keep track of the organization's money, accounting and financial dealings.
