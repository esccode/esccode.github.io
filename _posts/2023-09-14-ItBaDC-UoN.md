## Introduction to Blockchain and Digital Currency

**Introduction to Blockchain and Digital Currency** is designed to provide an understanding of Blockchain technology and decentralised digital currencies and other types of digital assets.

Further to the online material posted each week, students will have the opportunity to interact in real-time with the course instructors in live weekly sessions. These sessions will be recorded and be made available to students that will not be able to watch them in real-time (although, of course, these students will miss the chance of asking questions to the course instructors!).

## Course Logistics

THIS COURSE WILL **START ON SEPTEMBER 25**

This will be the 19th run of this course. Students from 120 countries have attended this course since 2014.

Introduction to Blockchain and Digital Currency is a self-paced course that requires no prior technical background or knowledge. The course will:

- survey the theory and principles by which digital currencies operate;
- provide practical examples of basic transactions and operations of blockchain or distributed ledger based systems;
- explore the current and future interaction of digital currencies with banking, financial, legal and regulatory systems;
- help students understand the disruptive potential of blockchain and how this ecosystem can be perceived as an innovation;
- discuss the newest developments in the space (for example, tokenisation, DeFi and CBDCs), explore the synergies between blockchain and other disruptive technologies (such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things) and provide a vision and thesis for a decentralised future.

At the end of the course, students who successfully qualify will receive their free academic certificates whose authenticity can be digitally verified through the Bitcoin blockchain.
