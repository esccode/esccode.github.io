## Common Vulnerability Scoring System

> The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is free and open industry standard for ossessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities. CVSS attempts to assign severity scores to vulnerabilities, allowing responders to prioritize and resources according to threat. Scores are calculated based on a formula that depends on several metrics that approximate ease and impact of an exploit. Scores range from 0 to 10, with 10 being the most sever. While many utilize only the CVSS Base score for determining severity, temporal and environmental scores also exist, to factor in availability of mitigation and how widespreadvulnerable systems are within an organization, respectively.  
> The current version of CVSS (CVSSv3.1) was released in June 2019.
