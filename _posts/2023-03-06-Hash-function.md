## Hash function

Is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output.  The value returned by a hash function are called *hash values, hash codes, digests*, or *simply hashes*. The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called *hashing* or *scatter storage addressing*
