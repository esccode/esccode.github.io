> Since that time, the hand moved closer and closer to midnight because of the climate crisis and geopolitical problems. Last week, scientists moved the clock's hand to 90 seconds to midnight. We are closer to destroying the planet than ever before.

Other countries including Finland, Poland, and the United Kingdom are also thinking they may send tanks to Ukraine.

## A truck loses radioactive material -- level 2

A radioactive capsule contained Caesium-137; it fell of a truck and landed on the side of the road in a remote Australian region.  
Mining company Rio Tinto uses the capsule to measure iron ore which comes from its mine in the Kimberley area. The company apologized for the accident and said that the capsule probably didn't pollute the area.  
100 people spent one week searching for the capsule, but the task was very difficult. They had to search a 1,400-kilometer-long area along the highway. Authorrities warned people to stay at least five meters away from the capsule if they saw it. They could get radiation sickness or burns.

*Difficult words*: **component** (a part of a machine or vehicle), **supply chain** (all the people and companies who make and deliver a product), **photovoltaic technology**(materials and devices which change sunlight into electricity).

The company asked the Rotterdam municipality to dismantle the bridge, which made many people very angry. The bridge was a historical place, and workers repaired it in 2017.  
The price of the yacht was about 430 milion dollars, and it was the biggest yacht in the world. Jeff Bezos said that he would pay for the work on the bridge.
