> When the clock first started ticking, its hand was seven minutes before midnight. When the Soviet Union tested the first atomic bomb in 1949, scientists moved the clock's hand to three minutes to midnight. In 1991, the hand moved down to 17 minutes to midnight, the farthest it ever was.  
> Since that time, the hand moved closer and closer to midnight because of the climate crisis and geopolitical problems. Last week, scientists moved the clock's hand to 90 seconds to midnight. We are closer to destroying the planet than ever before.

Other countries including Finland, Poland, and the United Kingdom are also thinking they may send tanks to Ukraine.

*Difficult words: **tank** (a very heavy vehicle to fight), ambassador (a person who lives in a foreign country and he represents his own), provocation (words or actions to make somebody else angry).

## A truck loses radioactive material -- level 2

A radioactive capsule contained Caesium-137; it fell of a truck and landed on the side of the road in a remote Australian region.  
Mining company Rio Tinto uses the capsule to measure iron ore which comes from its mine in the Kimberley area. The company apologized for the accident and said that the capsule probably didn't pollute the area.  
100 people spent one week searching for the capsule, but the task was very difficult. They had to search a 1,400-kilometer-long area along the highway. Authorrities warned people to stay at least five meters away from the capsule if they saw it. They could get radiation sickness or burns.  
*Difficult words*: **capsule** (a small container), **remote** (very far away), radiation (a dangerous energy from the smallest objects called atoms).
