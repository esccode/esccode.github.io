## Jacinda Ardern resigns

> *25 January 2023*  
> On Thursday, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that she would resign before 7th of February, 2023. The news surprised everyone because she was one of the most successful leaders of the country.
> During her career, Ardern responded to the Christchurch mass shooting, the 2019 volcano eruption, and the COVID-19 pandemic.
> Difficult words: **announce**(to say something in public), **resign**(to officially leave a job), **mass shooting** (an incident when an attacker kills people with a gun).

## Doomsday Clock- level 2

> *01 Feb 2023*  
> In 1947, a group of scientists including Albert Einstein created the so-called Doomsday Clock.  
> Every, year, nuclear and climate experts meet and move the clock's hand. if the scientists think that the world is getting closer to a **catastrophe**, they move its hand closer to midnight.  
> When the clock first started ticking, its hand was seven minutes before midnight. When the Soviet Union tested the first atomic bomb in 1949, scientists moved the clock's hand to three minutes to midnight. In 1991, the hand moved down to 17 minutes to midnight, the farthest it ever was.  
> Since that time, the hand moved closer and closer to midnight because of the climate crisis and geopolitical problems. Last week, scientists moved the clock's hand to 90 seconds to midnight. We are closer to destroying the planet than ever before.  
> *Difficult words*: **catastrophe** (a sudden tragic event), **climate crisis**(dangerous changes of the world's weather and impact of theese changes), **geopolitical** (the politics of a country or area).
